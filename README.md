# Task Manager Application with User Service

This project consists of two microservices:

1. **user-service**: Manages user information.
2. **task-manager**: Manages tasks assigned to users. This service communicates with the user-service to validate user data.

Each service uses its own MongoDB instance and is containerized using Docker.
